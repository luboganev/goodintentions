<h2>Good intentions - The Intent test playground!</h2>
</p>

<h4>About the app</h4>
Good intentions helps you test the behavior of the framework or your own application by building custom Intent objects and using them to start activities, services or send broadcasts. The UI provides simple way of defining almost all Intent parameters and a couple of ways of launching the Intents. 

<h4>This project is open source!</h4>
This app is built during the free time of the developer for fun. It provides with a tool to test some Intent behavior while building and testing other apps or just for fun playing with the framework. ;) If you are interested in the app's internals, just check the project's <a href="https://github.com/luboganev/goodintentions/">GitHub page</a>.
