About
-----

This app is built during the free time of the developer for fun. It provides with a tool to test some 
Intent behavior while building and testing other apps or just for fun playing with the framework. ;)
This app would not work and feel the same way if it weren't for 
some great Android open-source projects that were used during the development.

* [Android open source project][2]
* [Butter Knife][3]
* [Google GSON][4]
